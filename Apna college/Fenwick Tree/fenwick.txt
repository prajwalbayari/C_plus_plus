These are also called as Binary Indexed Tree

Whenever we need to find the sum of elements of a range in an array it would take O(n) time 
This can be reduced to O(1) using prefix sum array but updating an element would take O(n)
time again.

In Fenwick trees there will be nodes marked as Responsible 

To update an entry we have to delete the previous value and add new value to all nodes that 
are Responsible for that index.The responsible nodes can be found using the method of adding
LSB to current node and updating it.

To find the sum of a range we have to add values of all nodes which are all responsibilities 
of the given node. The nodes that are responsibilities of a node can be obtained by subtracting
LSB from it
